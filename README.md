## 🖼️ Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are visual blueprints of a user interface that outline the structure and functionality of a webpage or application screen. They serve as a foundational tool in the design phase, helping stakeholders visualize layout and flow before development begins.

Here are the key elements commonly found in a wireframe:

### 🧱 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall framework of the page, organizing space into logical sections such as header, footer, sidebar, and main content area.

**Example:**  
In a booking system, the layout might include:
- A top navigation bar for quick access to features
- A left sidebar for filtering bookings by date or location
- A main panel displaying available booking slots

**Contribution:**  
Creates a consistent and intuitive structure that improves user experience and guides design decisions.

---

### 🧭 2. Navigation
Represents the menus, links, and buttons that allow users to move through the application.

**Example:**  
A navigation bar with links like:
- Home
- Book Now
- My Bookings
- Profile
- Logout

**Contribution:**  
Helps users find and access key features quickly, ensuring ease of use and logical user flow.

---

### 📄 3. Content Placement
Indicates where text, images, forms, and other content will appear on the screen.

**Example:**  
On a checkout page, the content placement might show:
- A booking summary on the left
- A payment form on the right
- A "Confirm Booking" button at the bottom

**Contribution:**  
Ensures that important information is prioritized and accessible, enhancing clarity and user decision-making.

---

### ⚙️ 4. Functionality
Highlights interactive elements such as buttons, dropdowns, input fields, and sliders.

**Example:**  
- A date picker for selecting reservation dates
- A “Filter” button to update available options
- An input field to enter promo codes

**Contribution:**  
Represents how users will interact with the interface, helping developers understand behaviors and user flows.

Wireframes play a crucial role in aligning design vision with business goals, enabling early feedback, and reducing costly changes later in development.
## 🧾 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail and complexity depending on the stage of the design process. The two most common types are **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** wireframes.

### 🪶 Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are simple, sketch-like representations of a user interface. They focus on structure and layout rather than detailed design.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal detail, often black-and-white
- Uses placeholders for images and text
- Quick and easy to create

**When to Use:**
- During early brainstorming or ideation
- When gathering initial feedback from stakeholders
- To outline user flows and layout ideas before investing time in design

**Example Use Case:**
Sketching out the main pages of a booking system to determine how users will navigate from search to checkout.

### 🎯 High-Fidelity Wireframes

High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are more detailed and closely resemble the final product. They include accurate spacing, content, colors, and often simulate interactions.

**Characteristics:**
- Detailed visual elements and real content
- Shows UI components like buttons, dropdowns, and icons
- May include responsive behavior and user interaction

**When to Use:**
- During the later stages of design
- For developer handoff or usability testing
- When presenting a polished concept to stakeholders

**Example Use Case:**
A clickable mockup of the checkout page in a booking management app that includes form validation and payment fields.
