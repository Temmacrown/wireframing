## üñºÔ∏è Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are visual blueprints of a user interface that outline the structure and functionality of a webpage or application screen. They serve as a foundational tool in the design phase, helping stakeholders visualize layout and flow before development begins.

Here are the key elements commonly found in a wireframe:

### üß± 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall framework of the page, organizing space into logical sections such as header, footer, sidebar, and main content area.

**Example:**  
In a booking system, the layout might include:
- A top navigation bar for quick access to features
- A left sidebar for filtering bookings by date or location
- A main panel displaying available booking slots

**Contribution:**  
Creates a consistent and intuitive structure that improves user experience and guides design decisions.

### üß≠ 2. Navigation
Represents the menus, links, and buttons that allow users to move through the application.

**Example:**  
A navigation bar with links like:
- Home
- Book Now
- My Bookings
- Profile
- Logout

**Contribution:**  
Helps users find and access key features quickly, ensuring ease of use and logical user flow.

### üìÑ 3. Content Placement
Indicates where text, images, forms, and other content will appear on the screen.

**Example:**  
On a checkout page, the content placement might show:
- A booking summary on the left
- A payment form on the right
- A "Confirm Booking" button at the bottom

**Contribution:**  
Ensures that important information is prioritized and accessible, enhancing clarity and user decision-making.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Functionality
Highlights interactive elements such as buttons, dropdowns, input fields, and sliders.

**Example:**  
- A date picker for selecting reservation dates
- A ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù button to update available options
- An input field to enter promo codes

**Contribution:**  
Represents how users will interact with the interface, helping developers understand behaviors and user flows.

Wireframes play a crucial role in aligning design vision with business goals, enabling early feedback, and reducing costly changes later in development.
